## Support v4.0.0 of device-disconnector
<!--

The device disconnector softwate version 4.0.0 adds support for basic REST API
endpoints like `/get/version` and `/get/usb`.
On top of this the POST endpoint to set switch pin and USB port states moved
from `/` to `/set` accepting now multiple parameters at once.
This change adds support for that software version in a backwards compatible
way by checking the response of the `/get/version` endpoint and posting the
data in the required format to the required endpoint.
